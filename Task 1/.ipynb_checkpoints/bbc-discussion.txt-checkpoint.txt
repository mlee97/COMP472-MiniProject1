The distribution of articles amongst the classes is relatively balanced. This means that each class is well represented in this dataset
and carries equal importance. As such, accuracy is more well-suited for this dataset (over Recall, Precision & F-measure).

The performance of steps 8-10 differed from one another when we involved data that was predicted by the classifier. This means that
metrics like Recall, Precision, F1-measure, etc... were different because the results of the prediction changed after each trial.
On the other hand, steps that involve the entire corpus like vocabulary size (f) or number of words with frequency 1 over the entire
corpus (j) would remain the same from one trial to another.
