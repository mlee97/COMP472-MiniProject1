- Anaconda
- Jupyter Lab

## Instructions
1. Download repository
2. Install Anaconda3
3. Open Anaconda Navigator
4. In the applications menu, launch Jupiter Lab
5. In the file browser, locate the directory where you downloaded the repository.
6. To access the python code in Task 1, open Task 1/Task1_src.ipynb
7. To access the python code in Task 2, open Task 2/Task2_src.ipynb
8. Once a file has been selected, press 'Run the selected cells and advance'
9. Each file should output 3 txt files, one for distribution, one for performance, and one for discussion. All files should appear in the same directory as the python code.
10. TROUBLESHOOTING: Click on the stop button ('Interupt the kernel'), if it appears that the code isn't outputting properly.
